## Overview

This project delves into various web development techniques, divided into three main areas: **Styling and Presentation**, **Server-Side Rendering**, and **Client-Side Rendering**.

### Styling and Presentation

Responsive web layouts were created using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. For more details, please refer to the `readme.md` files located in the `css-responsive-layout` and `tailwind-responsive-layout` folders.

### Server-Side Rendering

A Kanban board was developed using Ruby on Rails, employing a test-driven development process and exploring the application of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

### Client-Side Rendering

#### JavaScript

Asynchronous functions were implemented in various ways. Detailed explanations can be found in the `js-async` folder's `readme.md`.

#### Document Object Model

A microblogging Single Page Application (SPA) was created using the DOM API, where data was fetched from a JSON backend. For more details, see the `readme.md` in the `dom-microblogging` folder.

#### Web Components

Another SPA was built using Web Components, implementing reusable components encapsulated with a Shadow DOM. Data was also fetched from a JSON backend. More details are available in the `webc-microblogging` folder's `readme.md`.

#### React

To enhance application performance, a client-side framework (React) was used to synchronize a virtual DOM with the actual DOM. A microblogging website was developed with React, fetching data from an existing JSON backend. For more information, check the `react-microblogging` folder.

### General Technologies

Throughout the project Node.js was used, Docker was used to run applications in isolated containers, and Git was used for version control.
